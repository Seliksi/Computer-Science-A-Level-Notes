### Vonn Neumann architecture
The vonn Neumann architecture is characterised by **one** [address space](<RAM#Address space>) being used to store both active programs and their allocated data in primary memory. Additionally, this address space is also physically connected by **one** data bus (i.e a single hardware connection between the CPU and RAM). Vonn Neumann architectures are often associated with [CISC](<RISC and CISC>) processors, as the disadvantage of non-parallel instruction and data access can be mimised by allowing for more complex and expressive instructions. ^4059d1
