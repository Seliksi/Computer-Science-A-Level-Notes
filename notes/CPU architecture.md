#### Comparison

Category|vonn Neumann|Harvard
--|--|--
Speed|The vonn Neumann architecture is generally less performant, as the singular data bus forces instructions and data to be accessed sequentially, whereas they'll actually be required together ([[SISD]]).|0
Flexability|The combination of these two categories of memory allows for a greater degree of flexability in what techniques a program can use - data can be carefully and cleverly processed as instructions (and vice versa), allowing for very dynamic computation. |0
