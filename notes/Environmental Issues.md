#### Technology costs Natural Resources
Electronic devices require lots of raw materials, such as plastics and metals. Plastics are produced from crude oil, a non-renewable resource. Many of the metals used (i.e. precious metals such as gold, mercury, or platinum) only occur in tiny quantities; extracting these consumes large amounts of energy, creates pollution and depletes scarce natural resources.

#### Technology costs Electricity
The majority of electricity production uses non-renewable resources such as coal, oil, and gas. Extracting these resources and converting them into usable electricity produces large amounts of pollution and reduces the remaining viable stores in the ground - eventually leading to them running out.
All electronics produce heat, and therefore powerful computers require cooling. Large fans, water cooling, and specially climate-controlled rooms all consume large amounts of electricity themselves.
The common use-patterns of devices also contributes to additional energy usage: personal computers are rarely used at a continuous 100% usage of potential processing power, and are often left idling for long periods of time. As a result, these devices consume large amounts of electricity without doing anything.

#### Technology produces Waste
20-50 million tonnes of electronic waste are produced every year.
