### The CPU (Central Processing Unit)
The CPU is the main [processor](Processor) of the computer system. It is the component which is generally responsible for [executing instructions on data](<Fetch, Decode, Execute cycle>) - a process who's exact order and structure is determined by the code of the program which is being ran. As a CPU is a *digitial* electronic device, both the instructions and data are internally represented as [binary](Binary) numbers. When formatted in [binary](Binary), the program is said to be [machine code](<Machine code>), and the instructions and data are [opcodes](Opcodes) and [operands](Operands) respectively.

##### CPU Structure, Types and Architecture

The ['structure'](CPU%20structure.md) (also refered to as <u>'architecture'</u>) of the CPU describes the properties and design of the components which make up the CPU, and how they interact with eachother & the other parts of the computer system. The CPU has many general purpose [registers](Registers.md) and a set number of [special purpose registers](Registers.md#Sec2), which are primarily used to fufil specific roles during the [fetch, decode, execute cycle](<Fetch, Decode, Execute cycle>). 
The ['architecture'](CPU%20architecture.md) of the CPU can **also** be used to describes the categorical specialisation of how memory is shared between programs and data. The most common architectures are: 
- The [von Neumann architecture](<Von Neumann architecture>) 
- The [Harvard architecture](<Harvard architecture>)
- The [contemporary processor architecture](<Contemporary processor architecture>) <span style="color:gray">(a combination of both the von Neumann and Harvard architectures; most commonly used in practice)</span>
